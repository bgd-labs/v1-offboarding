# V1 Deprecation PART3

This repository contains the upgraded `Pool` contract required for the V1 Deprecation PHASE 3 as described on [the forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-bgd-further-aave-v1-deprecation-strategy/15893/7).

The `Pool` is upgraded in order to prevent any action on the pool.
This is done, so a merkle distribution can happen with accurate values for each user.

- see [HERE](https://github.com/bgd-labs/v1-offboarding/tree/005cdb3f1db358f6aa3b71d59b218b12301e825e) for PART1
